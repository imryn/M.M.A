Small movie app. Include 3 main processes:

1. list of movies that include basic info: 
    - name of the movie
    - poster 
    - year of production
    
2. add new movie to list.
3. search review of a movie

Developed with Angular 7 and used the "New York Times" API movies for getting the reviews.
